        <p>Come, come, you talk greasily; your lips grow foul. Hast thou never an eye in thy head? Thou clouted crook-pated hugger-mugger! Thou dissembling idle-headed pigeon-egg! Thou mangled fen-sucked bum-bailey! Thou leathern-jerkin, crystal-button, knot-pated, agatering, puke-stocking, caddis-garter, smooth-tongue, Spanish pouch! Thou rank hedge-born boar-pig! Thou wimpled clapper-clawed flax-wench! Thou qualling unwash'd devil-mon!</p>

        <p>Thou accursed guts-griping promise-breaker! Thou clouted pox-marked canker-blossom! Thou appeareth nothing to me but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. Thou clouted pox-marked canker-blossom! Thou slanderous clay-brained fustilarian! Thou wayward rough-hewn malt-horse! Thou dankish motley-minded bear-whelp! Thou withered bat-fowling imbossed carbunkle!</p>

        <p>You base football-player! You crooked-nose knave! You puterell, you skalemar. You hedge-born levereter, you bedswerver fopdoodle! Ye olde mucksprout and mumblecrust. You rakefile skobberlotcher. Thou subtle, perjur’d, false, disloyal man! Thou art like a toad; ugly and venomous. A most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly promise breaker, the owner of no one good quality. Thou are pigeon-liver’d and lack gall. Thine face is not worth sunburning. You are as a candle, the better burnt out.</p>
